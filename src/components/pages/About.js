            <br />
            Hello! My name Jia Peng Zhen, or you can just call me Alex. I aspire
            to become a software engineer and web developer
            <br />
            <br />
            <em className="em_p">Education:</em>
            <br />
            I graduated in 2020 from The City College of New York, where I
            studied Computer Science.
            <br />
            <br />
            <em className="em_p">Work experience:</em>
            <br />
            I currently don't have experience in the software engineer industry,
            but I'm willing to learn and take my skills to the next level.
            <br />

            <em className="em_p">A little more about me:</em>
            <br />I was born and raised in Venezuela. Before coming to the
            United States, I studied in China for a few years. This allows me to
            gain a deeper understanding of different cultures and a new global
            perspective on cultural and social values. Besides coding, I enjoy
            playing various sports in my free time. During the summer, I play
